1.0 SUMMARY & STEP-BY-STEP
=======================================================================================================
This bot is meant to be a prototype to gain experience in creating chat bots for Twitch. Currently, the
only useful command is !rank which retrieves OSMS rankings.

Currently the bot is functional, and the only thing that needs to be changed is which channel the bot 
will enter, and the owner of the bot. 

Disclaimer: This is my first attempt at a documentation, and I'm tired.

Details:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Server Name: irc.twitch.tv
	Port: 6667

Preqrequisites:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	1. Name of channel to join
	2. Twitch account
	3. OAuth token to use as password. Get it from here -> http://www.twitchapps.com/tmi/
	4. Webdriver for a browser. Links here -> https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html#drivers
		-Webdrivers open a corresponding browser to retrieve the HTML data for !rank.
		-Currently using, and recommend Firefox() with geckodriver.exe
		-Place webdriver in bot folder, or PATH, or Firefox(path/to/webdriver)
	5. Install Selenium (for javascript scraping + parsing):
		$ pip install selenium


Connecting bot to Twitch:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	1. Enter bot name, owner name, OAuth token.
	2. Select channel to send the bot to. 
	3. Run script in shell

Some command notes:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	- The variable "message" contains the last message sent in chat
	- To have the bot chat use sendMessage function:
		sendMessage(s, "What the bot will say")

2.0 OSMS Ranking
=======================================================================================================
Overview
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	- !rank player_char, returns the player_char's rank
		- Also an emote based on rank


	- OSMS uses javascript to visualize their rankings, i.e. requests library, urllib don't work
		- This requires the selenium library to scrape the HTML
	- Not the fastest, slight delay before message is sent, not awful though
	

Known Issues
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	- Will return only the first result -> works best if full character name is used
	- Sometimes the search just fails for no reason, unsure why >_>.
	- As OSMS uses an image to represent top 3 players, it doesn't work on aformentioned toons. (LOL)
		- Would require to add another search query, but the current one isn't even that reliable.
	- Sometimes queries take slightly longer for no good reason. 

Possible Features
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	- Top 10 rankers
	- Search by level
	- Job rank
